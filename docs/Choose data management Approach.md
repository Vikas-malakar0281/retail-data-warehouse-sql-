# 🗂️ Choose Data Management Approach

## 📦 Type of Data Architecture

In the world of modern data systems, several architectural options exist for managing data at scale:

- **Data Warehouse** – Centralized, structured storage optimized for analytics and reporting  
- **Data Lake** – Scalable storage for raw, semi-structured, and unstructured data  
- **Data Lakehouse** – Hybrid approach combining warehouse performance with lake flexibility  
- **Data Mesh** – Domain-oriented decentralized architecture promoting data product ownership

✅ **Selected Architecture for this Project:**  
We are building a traditional **Data Warehouse**, as it aligns best with our structured retail dataset and analytical reporting goals.

## 🧱 Approach to Build the Data Warehouse

Several methodologies are commonly used to design and implement a data warehouse:

- **Inmon Approach** – Top-down design, normalized structures  
- **Kimball Approach** – Bottom-up, dimensional modeling (star/snowflake schemas)  
- **Data Vault** – Agile, scalable, highly normalized method for historical tracking  
- **Medallion Architecture** – Layered approach: Bronze (raw), Silver (clean), Gold (business)

✅ **Selected Approach for this Project:**  
We are adopting the **Medallion Architecture**, which breaks the data warehouse into three logical layers:

1. **🥉 Bronze Layer** – Raw staging tables loaded from CSVs  
2. **🥈 Silver Layer** – Cleaned, deduplicated, and joined data  
3. **🥇 Gold Layer** – Fact and dimension tables optimized for business use and reporting

This layered structure ensures **clarity, modularity, and data quality** across the pipeline.
